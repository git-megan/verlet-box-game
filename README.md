# Verlet Box Game
This is a simple game I created as a final project for one of my creative coding classes. Game objective - keep the boxes floating and off the ground. At each level, boxes with different properties and physics will appear. Move the platform around clicking the blocks on the left and right of it, and use the platform to keep the boxes from touching the ground.

I created it in Processing, and to play the game, the code will need to be run in the Processing Development Environment (PDE).
